        I feel ashamed
        Again and again
        Nothing to give
        And no one to blame
        During the day
        I guess I'm okay [x2]
        
        At night I sit by your side
        Waiting for you
        To give me a sign
        I'm counting the days
        And you have nothing to say
        
        Ahhhhhh
        
        I hope I can chill and stay the same
        Stop the bleed inside
        And feel again
        Cut the chain of lies
        You've been my feeding my veins
        I got nothing to say to you
        
        I hope I can chill and stay the same
        Stop the bleed inside
        And feel again
        Cut the chain of lies
        I've been beating and beating and beating myself...
        
        Without nothing to say to you, nothing to say to you...
